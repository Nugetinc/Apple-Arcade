It is a silly physics-based golf parody where each level is a new surprising type of golf. Some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd you will ask yourself: WHAT THE GOLF?\n\nIT’S REALLY NOT GOLF\n\nBut it’s a lot of other things! Cats, couches, horses, cars, TV’s, tennis, dogs, flags, flying houses, a fax machine… You name it, we golf it!\n\nEXPLORE THE LAB\n\nWhat has happened in the golf lab? Why is it called a hole-in-one and not a house-in-one? Are there really no limits to what you can golf?\n\nWANT MORE? WE GOT YOU\n\nNew episodes dropping/released often, you can already check out:\n\nIt’s Snowtime: An epic adventure of frozen pizza and pineapple\n\nA Hole New World: Golf, now with holes!\n\nSporty Sports: Where all the sports are golf!\n\n…and many more to come!\n\nUpdates for special holidays, including:\n\nInternational Cat Day (Catch the laser!)\n\nHalloween (A tricky little treat)\n\nWorld Maritime Day (That one was “aboat\" time)\n\nThanksgiving (Because turkeys are the only birdies you need!)\n\nValentines Day (A love story between a horse and a golf ball)\n\n…and more!\n\nDISCLAIMER!!\n\nThis game is made by people who know nothing about golf. It will NOT make you a better golf player!\n",
